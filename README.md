# SemEval 2020 Task11
This is the repository for the SemEval 2020 Task 11 related topics.

The repository includes file semeval20-task11.bib, which is intended to contain 
all the bib entries for task 11, both by participants and by organisers. Having 
this centralised bib file will ease to cite all papers properly and will 
guarantee that the format is as expected. 

We ask participants to add your own bib entry and do a pull request to add it to 
the main branch. To do that, copy the available example available at the 
[same file](https://github.com/albarron/semeval20_task11/blob/24a30c237bbf551d48a3c1127dca82622d462efb/semeval20-task11.bib#L3).
After copying to create your own entry, substitute the uppercase sections with your
own data (e.g., the identifier, authors, and title). The task overview paper entry 
is available by the [end of the file](https://github.com/albarron/semeval20_task11/blob/24a30c237bbf551d48a3c1127dca82622d462efb/semeval20-task11.bib#L18) for your reference.
