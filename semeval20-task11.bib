In the first task, systems are asked to identify specific text spans in a free text where propaganda is being applied. In the second task, systems are asked to identify the propaganda technique being applied in a text span. We describe the construction of the evaluation framework (dataset and evaluation metrics) as well as the approaches explored by the different participants. ",
